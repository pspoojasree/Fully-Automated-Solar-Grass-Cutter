# Fully-Automated-Solar-Grass-Cutter

## Overview
  This project focuses on developing a Solar-Powered Automated Grass Cutting Machine designed to operate with minimal human intervention. The machine uses solar energy to power its motor, contributing to energy efficiency and sustainability.
The grass cutter operates autonomously using sensors and motors, providing a practical solution for lawn and garden maintenance. By leveraging renewable energy, the project demonstrates the potential of solar-powered automation in everyday applications.

## Working Principle
The system is powered by a solar panel that charges the battery, which in turn powers the motors and sensors. The Arduino controller coordinates the movement of the machine and the cutting motor. Ultrasonic sensors are used to detect obstacles, and the machine autonomously moves around them by diverting its path when necessary. The grass cutting motor spins the tempered blades at high speeds, efficiently cutting the grass.

## Features
* Solar-Powered: Runs on solar energy, reducing reliance on conventional electricity.
* Autonomous: Uses ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and navigation.
* Efficient Cutting: High RPM motor ensures smooth, precise grass cutting.
